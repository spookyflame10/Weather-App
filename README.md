# Weather-App
Simple Weather App created with HTML, SASS, and JS. Used the Open Weather API for data. Utilized Asynchonous calls to the API so that the website wont lag while fetching data.    
### Improvements
Will look to add a hourly and week forecast. Also will add better styling. Will also encrypt API key.
